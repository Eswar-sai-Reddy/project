                 <h1>TYPES OF CYBER CRIMES</h1>
                       <p>
			   <h2>COMPUTER FRAUD</h2>
                           It is the act of using a computer to take or alter electronic data, or to gain unlawful use of a computer or system. If computer fraud involves Internet use, it can be considered Internet fraud. The legal definition of computer fraud varies by jurisdiction but typically involves accessing a computer without permission or authorization.
Forms of computer fraud include hacking into computers to alter information, distributing malicious code such as computer worms or viruses, installing malware or spyware to steal data, phishing, and advance-fee scams.
Other forms of fraud may be facilitated using computer systems, including bank fraud, carding, identity theft, extortion, and theft of classified information. These types of crimes often result in the loss of private or monetary information

			   <h2>CYBER TERRORISM</h2>
                           Cyberterrorism, in general, can be defined as an act of terrorism committed through the use of cyberspace or computer resources. Acts of deliberate, large-scale disruption of computer networks, especially of personal computers attached to the Internet, by means such as computer viruses, computer worms, phishing, malicious software, hardware methods, or programming scripts can all be forms of cyberterrorism.

                       </p>
                       <p>
			   <h2>CYBER EXTORTION</h2>
                           Cyberextortion is a type of extortion that occurs when a website, e-mail server, or computer system is subjected to or threatened with attacks by malicious hackers, such as denial-of-service attacks. Cyber extortionists demand money in return for promising to stop the attacks and to offer "protection". Perpetrators typically use a distributed denial-of-service attack. However, other cyber extortion techniques exist, such as doxing, extortion, and bug poaching.
An example of cyberextortion was the attack on Sony Pictures of 2014.
